# COVID-prediction-model

This COVID-19 detection model leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of a patient testing positive for COVID-19 based on a range of symptoms and medical history. The model is trained using a dataset that includes various health-related factors such as age, gender, symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, difficulty breathing), underlying conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, asthma), and critical care indicators (e.g., ICU, intubation, pneumonia). A Random Forest Classifier is used for this prediction task, offering a robust and accurate method for classification. The model is integrated into a Flask web application, where users can input their symptoms and medical details via an interactive form. The application processes the inputs, makes predictions in real-time, and provides users with the result of whether they are at risk of COVID-19 based on their symptoms. This setup is aimed at offering an accessible, user-friendly solution for preliminary screening of COVID-19 risk.
